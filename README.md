# EAOWS
This repository contains the code used for processing the data from the database "European Atlantic Offshore Wave Spectral Climatology under Historical and Future Climate Scenarios", which is hosted in the CEDA archive.

Currently, only one file is included (netcdf_to_sp2.py), which is described below:

- Python script to convert NetCDF daily spectral files into .sp2 format required by SWAN for spectral forcing.
- Input: NetCDF files with dimensions (time x location x frequency x direction).
- Output: .sp2 plain-text files that allow starting SWAN simulations.
- Usage instructions and metadata are included in the script's header.
